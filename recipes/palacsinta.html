        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Palacsinte are flat round cakes, similar to pancakes, but thinner and made with a different dough. They are similar to the French crÃªpes, though Palacsinte are slightly thicker.

                <li>Heat the pan well. Add a drop of oil and spread it around.</li>
                <li>Ladle a dipperful of the batter into the pan, tilting the pan so that the batter spreads as evenly as possible over the whole pan.</li>
                <li>Let cook about 45 seconds to 1 minute until the top of the palacsinta is dry.</li>
                <li>Flip the pancake over, and allow it to brown for about 30 seconds on the other side. Remove from the pan, and set aside.</li>
                <li>Repeat the cooking process until you have used up all the batter.</li>
